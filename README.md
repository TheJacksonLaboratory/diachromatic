Differential analysis of chromatin interactions by capture

## Summary
This package will implement parts of the capture Hi-C pipeline as done in
HiCUP, but will do so in a way that is easily integrated with VPV. The final
part of the pipeline will perform differential analysis of 
promoter reads using a likelihood ratio test.

## Documentation
Documentation is being prepared for ReadTheDocs. We will not be able to publish the
documentation online until this repository is made public (probably in March.
Therefore, for now generate the documentation with

```aidl
$ cd docs
$ make html
```
And view the documentation as local files at 
``diachromatic/docs/_build/html/index.html 
``
